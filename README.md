# XamarinFormsAutofacMvvmStarterKitA basic starter kit for building MVVM Xamarin Forms applications with Autofac.## CreditsI want to thank Jonathan Yeats over at [Adventures In Xamarin Forms](http://adventuresinxamarinforms.com/2014/11/) for the base of this starter pack and for his permission to tweak it and publish it here.  His blog post really got me started off on the right foot with using Xamarin Forms in a testable fashion.  His posts are better written than I could, so I intend to leave his blog to be the "How and Why", here I will simply explain the tweaks I have added to his base.## Convention over configurationI've been using Jonathan's base in a fairly large app for work over they last year.  Having to register your views to the view model in the View Factory is a small annoyance that I have overcome with a small addition to the framework.  By placing all your view models in a namespace that ends with 'ViewModels' and ending their class names with 'VM', and your views similarly in a 'Views' namespace and end the class names with 'View', the framework will automagically pair up the view models with the view and will register them with the view factory.  To enable this, you simply need to pass the assembly that contains your view models and view to the constructor of your Bootstrapper.  Passing the assembly will also register all the views and view models that abide by the naming convention with the container as well.  So in the end, your bootstrapper class could look something like this:```csharppublic class Bootstrapper : CoreAutofacBootstrapper{	public Bootstrapper(Xamarin.Forms.Application app, Assembly autoRegisterAssembly) : base(autoRegisterAssembly)	{		App = app;	}	protected override void ConfigureApplication(IContainer container)	{		var viewFactory = container.Resolve<IViewFactory>();		var mainPage = viewFactory.Resolve<MainPageVM>();		var navigationPage = new NavigationPage(mainPage);		App.MainPage = navigationPage;	}	private readonly Xamarin.Forms.Application App;}```If you do not want to utilize the automatic view and view model registration, just call the empty constructor on the CoreAutofacBootstrapper base class.  No matter if you use automatic registration or not, you can always override the ```ConfigureContainer``` method in the bootstrapper to register any additional items you want with the container.  Likewise, if you have a view/view model pair that do not follow the naming convention, or if you just want to manage the ViewFactory yourself, you can override the ```RegisterViews``` method in the bootstrapper.- View Model navigation.- Convention over configuration automatic registration of views and view models.- Hooks View Model into Pushed, Popped, OnAppearing, and OnDisappearing events.- Automatic View Model disposal if it implments IDisposable when the view is popped off the navigation stack.- Interface to expose Xamarin.Forms.Device static class for testing purposes.
